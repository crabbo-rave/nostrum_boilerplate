[ ] Start game command with timer
[ ] Join button on the start command post
[ ] Race game (every second add a random distant from 1-5)
[ ] Show current person in lead in the race
[ ] For two wins a user can punish another users by making them go back 3. 
[ ] Have a genserver handle the game session, a dynamic supervisor to supervise the games, and registry to locate the genservers. (look at github/amadeus for reference)

TODO:
[ ] One race per channel. use agent for a boolean value. if someone tries to make a race during an ongoing one, send message link to game start. 
[ ] Maybe refactor Edits module agent into in Race module 

FIX:
[ ] disable join button when timer ends
[ ] message for ongoing game contains the message link
